# 💳 Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a predictive model that can detect fraudulent online payment transactions by analyzing user behavior and transaction patterns.


## 📌 Project Overview

Fraud detection in online payments is critical for secure financial transactions. This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent activities based on transactional data.


## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python
Pandas – for data handling
NumPy – for numerical operations
Scikit-learn – ML models and preprocessing
Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
SMOTE – to handle imbalanced datasets


## 📂 Dataset Features

- Transaction ID
- Amount
- Transaction Type
- User Age
- Device Type
- Transaction Time
- Is_Fraud(Target variable)
