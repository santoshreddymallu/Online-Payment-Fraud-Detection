# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection
-Designed and implemented a machine learning-based fraud detection system to identify suspicious payment 
transactions in real-time.-Utilized classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest for supervised learning and clustering 
algorithms like K-Means for unsupervised anomaly detection.-Processed and analyzed large-scale transaction datasets using Python (pandas, NumPy) to identify fraudulent behavior 
patterns.-Built and deployed a scalable system with REST APIs using Flask integrated with TensorFlow/Scikit-learn models.-Achieved a fraud detection accuracy of 99% while minimizing false positives through hyperparameter tuning and 
cross-validation
